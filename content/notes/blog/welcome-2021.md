The year 2020 is about to end, and it's the perfect time to reflect on our accomplishments and areas that need improvement. Let's take a look at what happened in 2020.

### Events

Even though this year was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, our enthusiasm for participating in various events remained high. In October last year, my team and I embarked on a fun project to participate in [Hacktoberfest 2020](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). We also attended several online events in Indonesia, such as online meetups hosted by [Deeptech](https://deeptech.id/) and the [SurabayaJS](https://surabayajs.org/) community.

### Side Projects

I also took on several side projects and helped classmates with their school assignments. This not only added to my knowledge but also helped me become more accustomed to working in teams.

### Sports

Despite the ongoing pandemic, I continued to engage in my favorite sport, soccer. I regularly practiced with the Merpati FC team on the field every afternoon. We even managed to secure third place in the Pordes tournament last August, and we became the overall champions in the Pordes event in 2020 by winning several competitions.

### School

With school being conducted online, there were times when I felt a bit lazy. However, I used this opportunity to learn new things and explore various technologies in the world of web development. Despite the challenges, I remained determined, as graduation is the ultimate goal.

### What's Ahead in 2021?

Many goals were left unachieved in 2020, and I don't have clear plans for 2021 yet. Nevertheless, I will approach the new year with enthusiasm and give it my all. Some plans for 2021 include:

- Learning React, VueJS, and NuxtJS
- Deepening my knowledge of Laravel and NodeJS
- Understanding Design Patterns
- Regularly reading books
- Actively contributing to Open Source projects
- And much more

## Please keep me in your prayers, and I hope to achieve all of these. Aamiin ☺️
