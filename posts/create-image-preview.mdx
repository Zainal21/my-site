title: Creating a Simple Image Preview
description: Image upload is one of the features in an application. Sometimes, we are unsure whether the image we input is correct. It's a good idea to provide an image preview feature before users submit the data. Let's dive into it.

Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarokatuh, Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹ How are you doing? I hope everything is going well. Have you ever created a website that includes a file input for images? Sometimes, we don't know if the file or image we input is correct.

Therefore, we need an **Image Preview** to display the image before the user submits it. This time, I will share how to do it using JavaScript, leveraging the DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation feature. However, we will also use the JQuery and Bootstrap libraries.

The required components include:

- JQuery
- Bootstrap

Here's an example implementation.

```html
<div class="form-group">
  <label>Cover</label>
  <div class="mb-2">
    <!-- Image preview placeholder -->
    <img
      src=""
      class="img-fluid"
      alt=""
      id="upload-img-preview"
      style="display: none; width: 200px;"
    /><br />
    <!-- Link used to delete the temporary image -->
    <a href="#" class="text-danger" id="upload-img-delete" style="display: none"
      >Delete Cover Image</a
    >
  </div>
  <!-- File input tag -->
  <div class="custom-file">
    <input
      type="file"
      accept="image/*"
      name="thumbnail"
      id="cover"
      class="custom-file-input js-upload-image form-control"
    />
    <label class="custom-file-label" for="cover">Choose file</label>
  </div>
</div>
```

Now, the user can preview the image before submitting it. This feature enhances the user experience on our website. That's all I can share with you for now. I hope it's helpful, and see you in the next post. Thank you! ðŸ™Œ
