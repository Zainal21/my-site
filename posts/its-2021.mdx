The year 2020 is just a few hours away from ending. As we prepare to welcome 2021, it's essential to summarize what has been accomplished and identify areas for improvement. So, let's recap 2020â€”check this out.

## Events

Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the enthusiasm to participate in exciting events persisted throughout the year. In October, my team and I embarked on a spontaneous project to take part in the [Hacktoberfest 2020](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) event. Additionally, we joined various online events in Indonesia, such as online meetups by [Deeptech](https://deeptech.id/) and the online meetup organized by the [SurabayaJS](https://surabayajs.org/) community.

## Side Projects

Engaging in several side projects and assisting friends with their coursework projects turned out to be a great way to gain knowledge and get accustomed to working in a team. It's always beneficial to learn and collaborate!

### Sports

Even amidst the pandemic, soccer remained a favorite sport. Regular training sessions with the Merpati FC team and preparations for the Pordes event in August paid off. Alhamdulillah, we secured the 3rd position and became the overall champion in the Pordes 2020, winning several competitions.

## School

As schooling remained online, it brought some laziness. Despite the challenges of online learning, it provided more time to explore new things and try various technologies in the world of web development.

However, graduation is on the horizon, so let's stay motivated and keep learning!

## Targets for 2021

Many goals from 2020 are still unmet, and there are no clear targets for 2021 yet. Let's approach it with maximum effort. Some plans for 2021 include:

- Learning React, VueJS, and NuxtJS
- Deepening knowledge in Laravel and NodeJS
- Learning Design Patterns
- Regularly reading books
- Actively contributing to open source projects
- And many more

Let's hope I can achieve all of these. Aamiin ðŸ˜„
