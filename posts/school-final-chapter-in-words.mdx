## Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh, Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I hope you're all doing well. The year 2021 marks the end of my school journey, facing real-life challenges, and unfortunately, the pandemic has somewhat dulled the school memories for me ðŸ˜¢.

## _What have I been up to in the last 3 years?_

In my first year of high school, having a basic IT background, I quickly adapted to the Software Engineering (RPL) field. I explored Graphic Design, Basic Computer and Networking, and Basic Programming. My favorite turned out to be Programming. In 10th grade, I learned VB.Net using Visual Studio, creating simple applications like calculators, number guessing games, and basic cashier applications.

The second year, often challenging for many, was exciting for me. I enjoyed the puzzles and challenges of programming. Sure, there were complaints, mostly about overwhelming assignments that made me forget to sleep â€“ a good kind of problem, I guess.

In 12th grade, I delved into Object-Oriented Programming, Web Programming, and System Analysis. I leaned towards Web Programming, having already dabbled in HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and explored Codeigniter3 and Laravel. In February, I started an internship as a junior web developer, using Laravel to build an online wedding invitation and a Village Information System. Unfortunately, the internship was cut short due to the sudden COVID-19 outbreak, shifting everything online. Even in 12th grade, the experience was less memorable due to online learning.

I participated in a Provincial-level Student Competency Competition representing my district and school in Web Technologies. Although I didn't win, the experience was valuable.

## _What's next for me?_

The post-school dilemma is real, whether to pursue higher education, work, or even get married. I've decided to work first, wanting to contribute to my family's happiness and learn new things in the tech world. Why not college? Well, the skills from high school seem sufficient for now, and I crave new learning experiences.

Marriage? Not anytime soon, maybe 7 or 8 years from now. I'm not ready, and there's no potential candidate yet. Pray for me to find a righteous and good one when the time comes.

_The Point is_ Make sure your decisions are well-thought-out, stay motivated to achieve your dreams, and remember, the road won't be as smooth as you imagine, so stay positive and be grateful! ðŸ™Œ

## _Hope for us all_

For those graduating in 2021, don't celebrate too soon. Real life is about to begin. Prepare yourselves, stay motivated, don't give up easily, be grateful, pray, and stay diligent in worship. May you all succeed, be useful for religion, country, and family. Amen! ðŸ™Œ

That's it, friends. Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts. Thank you, everyone. _Wassalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh!_
